# Module-18-Citibike
This is the analysis for my Tableau Public Workbooks and Storyboard
Men rode slightly more miles than women in June 2013 (we have exclude the riders that responded zero).  Those riders were actually more than either male or female....but we do not know what gender they may have been.

I had to filter the 2013 rider age details.  There were very many nulls in the birth year field.  Then I decided to only include riders born after 1930.  The oldest riders included in my sample were 83 and the youngest were 16.  We listed the minutes ridden by people in the age range (16-83).  I would like to continue searching out the rider ages:  to see if older riders continued to ride.  I would like to know if they rode for recreation or for travel through the city.  Perhaps to compare NYC stats to other regions of the US and perhaps Internationally.

My map included the start and end locations by Longitude and Latitude.  I included station names and ids.
