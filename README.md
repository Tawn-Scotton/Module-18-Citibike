# Module-18-Citibike
This is the analysis for my Tableau Public Workbooks and Storyboard
Men rode slightly more miles than women in June 2013.  Unfortunately so many respondents were unknown that you can not find a try value to this data. 
I had to filter the 2013 rider age details.  There were very many nulls in the birth year field.  Then I decided to only include riders born after 1930.  The oldest riders included in my sample were 83 and the youngest were 16.  We listed the minutes ridden by people in the age range (16-83).  I would like to continue searching out the rider ages:  to see if older riders continued to ride.  I would like to know if they rode for recreation or for travel through the city.  Perhaps to compare NYC stats to other regions of the US and perhaps Internationally.

My map included the start and end locations by Longitude and Latitude.  I included station names and ids.

If I were t make a calculated guess of the bikes that were most likely to need service during the time period, I would guess bikes that traveled over 10000 minutes (bikeid 15259, 17918, 19866, 17215, 18152)

Final thoughts:  I would like to continue working with the citibike data.  I would like to compare different years (same months) and seasons within the same year.  I am interested in looking for similar datasets in foreign countries to compare and contrast habits, ages and genders.  I wish there were journals included to see who rides for health, for travel, or just family fun.  In that same thought, is some of the data people riding together.  If you people ride in groups, do they ride more or less than single riders.  I definitely plan on looking more into this project.
